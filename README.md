# OysterToad

Are you an ASP.NET WebFroms expert?

Are you being asked to upgrade to ASP.NET Core or a more 'popular' front end framework like Angular, React, Vue, or Polymer?

Don't throw all that experience and legacy code away!  

Before you re-write, checkout OysterToad the drop in lightweight polyfill for WebForms.

## Instructions 

1. Add .html to the end of your .aspx filename.

2. Add Vue and Oyster links to the bottom of your .aspx.html page.

```
 </html>
 <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vue@2.5.17/dist/vue.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
 <script src="https://rawgit.com/EricRohlfs/OysterToad/master/src/oystertoad.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
